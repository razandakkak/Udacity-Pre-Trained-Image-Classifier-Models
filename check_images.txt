4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
I think all of them were good in terms of uploaded images, but for folder 
pet_images, and according to the reports:

ALEXNET:
pct_correct_dogs    : 100.00%
pct_correct_breed   : 80.00%
pct_correct_notdogs : 100.00%
pct_match           : 75.00%


RESNET:
pct_correct_dogs    : 100.00%
pct_correct_breed   : 90.00%
pct_correct_notdogs : 90.00%
pct_match           : 82.50%


VGG:
pct_correct_dogs    : 100.00%
pct_correct_breed   : 93.33%
pct_correct_notdogs : 100.00%
pct_match           : 87.50%

I would choose VGG, in terms of correct breed and match.
